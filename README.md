# Dragon-s-Match-3
My first published android application

This simple naughts and crosses game was created a part of my android studio studies.
This was before i found Xamarin Studio, but gave me a good insite into programing and working with Java

This project is now obsolete as it has been replaced with a Xamarin app.
